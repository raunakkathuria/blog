This post is about how to structure your To-do app as per the Getting Things Done (GTD) framework.

After trying out various tools-[Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)-to apply GTD methodology, I decided to go with Microsoft To-Do based on:

- Simplicity
- Free of Use
- Ease of Use
- Allows creation of a group to categorise lists

You can use any other To-do app or note tracking tool that lets you create groups and let you add lists to those groups.

In addition, the Microsoft To-Do app has feature of:

- setting weekly reminders, and
- adding multiple steps to a task if there are more than one action items for the respective task.

I still use Notion for storing reference documents and links as it is good at that, and a calendar for tracking meetings.

## Prerequisite

- Install [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/) or any To-do app
- Being aware of Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology

## GTD Overview

[Getting Things Done (GTD) book](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) has been a game changer for me in terms of productivity and time management.

The most important takeaway, as per me, from the book are:

- Your mind is great at creating stuff, but it’s terrible at tracking it. It is best to outsource tracking to a note tracking tool
- To be productive you need to think clearly, and for that, you have to capture all the "open loops"-unfulfilled commitments one has made to oneself-outside your mind. This frees the mind to do naturally what it does best - think about things rather than of things.

Getting things done requires two basic components:

1. **Outcome**. Defining what “done” means
2. **Action**. What “doing” looks like

The Five Steps of Mastering GTD Workflow

1. **Capture**. Collect what has your attention
2. **Clarify**. Process what it means
3. **Organize**. Put it where it belongs
4. **Reflect**. Review frequently
5. **Engage**. Simply do.

Let's see how we can achieve all the above by properly structuring your To-do app.

## Structuring To-do app for GTD framework

1. **Create Groups**

    Start by creating groups (capturing buckets in GTD terminology) to categorise your action items. Use the following categories as default, and adjust as per your need:

    ![To-do Groups]({{ "/assets/images/productivity/todo_groups.png" | relative_url }})

2. **Create Lists Per Group**

    Each category can have multiple To-do lists for structuring and organizing your action items

    ![Actionable Group]({{ "/assets/images/productivity/actionable_group.png" | relative_url }})

    Other important categories To-do list

    ![Other Important Groups]({{ "/assets/images/productivity/other_important_groups.png" | relative_url }})

    For each project, you can add multiple steps in Microsoft To-Do app

    ![Project Multiple Step]({{ "/assets/images/productivity/project_multiple_step.png" | relative_url }})

3. **Weekly Review**

    The weekly review is all about the following three steps:

    1. **Get clear**

        - *Collect Loose Papers and Materials*

            Gather all miscellaneous paper-based materials into your in-tray

        - *Get IN list/tray to Zero*

            Process completely all outstanding paper materials, journal and meeting notes, voicemails, dictation, and emails

        - *Empty your head*

            Put in writing and process any uncaptured new projects, action items, waiting for's, someday maybe's, etc

    2. **Get current**

        - *Review all the action list*

        - *Review upcoming calendar entries*

        - *Review Project (and Larger Outcome) Lists*

    3. **Get creative**

        - *Review Someday Maybe List*

        - *Be Creative and Courageous by adding new ideas to your lists*

    You can structure each item of the weekly review group as a multistep action item.
    Also, you can add a note to remind you of the activities to perform for each item of the review process, as shown below:

    ![Weekly review item]({{ "/assets/images/productivity/review_item_structure.png" | relative_url }})

## Summary

A to-do app is good for tracking action items, and you can efficiently manage your life by just putting a little extra initial effort into structuring and organizing your lists.

Having said that, it's best to complement the to-do app with a calendar application for tracking meetings, events, and reminders.
