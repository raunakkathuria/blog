Currently, I am working as a back-end manager for [deriv.com][deriv-url]{:target="_blank"} in Cyberjaya, Malaysia. In my free time, I love to read or learn something new to enhance my skills.

## ~~Leadership~~ Servant beliefs

- You are the servant of the team not the leader.
- Team success is the only thing that matters.
- We hired team members for a reason; trust them, let them grow.
- Encourage autonomy.
- Be supportive.

## Development beliefs

- Simplicity is one of the greatest virtue

    It doesn’t matter how good the website design or software application is, it’s going to be doomed if it doesn’t serve the purpose users are looking for. The first and foremost criteria for users is simplicity.

- Elegance

    After simplicity has been taken care of, comes the question - "how to present the content or application in a simple yet appealing way?". This is where creativity comes in, the website or application should be simple yet elegant. The content should not be masked by the design.

- Feedback

    As a designer or a developer, we have the tendency to think that whatever is designed needs no correction, but I think it’s important to consider the user feedback and incorporate it.

## Maxims of life

- Life is simple, don't complicate it.
- Life is to be happy, not to hold on to grudges.
- In life, be like d**k: flexible most of the time but firm when needed.
