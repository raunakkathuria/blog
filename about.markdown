Currently I am working as senior software developer for [binary.com][binary-url]{:target="_blank"} in Cyberjaya, Malaysia. On daily basis I work on designing, developing and enhancing features of our company portal [binary.com][binary-url]{:target="_blank"}. In my free time I love to work on designing website or to learn something new to enhance my skills.

## My web design beliefs – not atheist in web way

### Simplicity is one of the greatest virtue of life & design
It doesn’t matter how beautiful the website design is but it’s going to be doomed if it doesn’t serve the purpose users are looking for. As per me the first and foremost criteria for website users is simplicity.

### Elegance
After simplicity has been taken care of, comes the question of how to present the content in simple yet appealing way? For me this is the stage where designer creativity comes in, the site should be simple yet elegant, the content should not be masked by design. Users come to website for content not the design

### Feedback
As a designer/developer we have tendency to think that whatever is designed needs no correction but I think it’s important to consider the feedback and include it if possible.
